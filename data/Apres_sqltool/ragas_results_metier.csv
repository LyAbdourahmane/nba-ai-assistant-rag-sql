Quels sont les points forts de Julius Randle selon les rapports ?,"Julius Randle a montré plusieurs points forts selon les rapports. Sur le plan offensif, son ""bully ball"" fonctionne parfaitement, lui permettant de dominer physiquement en un contre un et de faire les bons choix quand il est doublé. Il a également amélioré son tir à trois points, avec un pourcentage de 45% cette saison, ce qui est un atout majeur pour l'équipe. Il est devenu un joueur plus complet, capable de dribler et de tirer en dribble, ce qui lui permet de fermer les matchs et de contrer les runs adverses.

Sur le plan défensif, Randle est plus engagé et concentré. Il joue avec son corps plutôt qu'avec ses mains, ce qui lui évite de commettre des fautes comme c'était le cas auparavant. Sa présence défensive a également contribué à épuiser des joueurs comme LeBron James.

Enfin, Randle est un joueur polyvalent qui peut jouer en iso et créer des opportunités pour ses coéquipiers.
