"We've seen multiple teams get to the finals without home court at all, the most famous case
the Rockets in 95, who won
title and had to beat the teams with the 4 best records in the league to do
But
never had home court at all.
The Knicks did it in the lock-out season in 99 and lost in the finals. The Heat
think did it twice with Jimmy
Butler.

Never in the NBA
That's because Hockey is the favourite sport of the
of randomness and lower seeds win way more
often than in basketball.
The NHL also has the same problem as the NBA of having the post-season be so much more intense that
it's almost a different sport. What worked for a 110 point President's Trophy winner in the regular season
may not work at all in the playoffs.

Never happened. For a team to make the final never having home court advantage you have to be the Sth
seed. So the finals, needs a 6th or lower_ but that's never happened because every finals contained at
least a Ist, 2nd or 3rd seed.

So let me start by saying
love Reggie miller. He was so entertaining: An absolutely bonkers clutch
shooter and magical at times.
That
said while im sure the numbers are correct, Reggie just isn't that great of a number 1. He never
really created his own shot. He had a terrifically balanced team that made teams focus on everyone and
not just focus on stopping Reggie
look at him as a
slightly better version of Klay Thompson who was also much more charismatic and
magical.

There is one caveat
can think of for Miller that might slightly skew the data in his favor:
As dangerous as he was, Miller could be taken out of a game more easily than other first options because
his shot creation game relied so much on moving off ball or creation through the triple threat; but his
ball-handling wasn't always flexible enough to probe defenses like a lot of others on this list:.
Teams that had success could just try and smother him off-ball and force him into playing off the dribble
more once he caught it, which is the less reliable part of his offensive game:
So he could be neutralized more effectively by forcing him to choose between
'no shot"" or a
""bad/difficult shot""
Reggie's lower-ish volume would suggest he skews towards ""no shot"" sometimes.
This is compared with other players that have more dangerous ISO/OTD games like Jordan; LeBron; or
even
Their
game leads to better playmaking and
shots near the rim. And in the case
of Jordan and
(or even Kawhi and Durant)
are more dangerous as hybrid threats.

---

shots near the rim. And in the case
of Jordan and
(or even Kawhi and Durant)
are more dangerous as hybrid threats.
So; while he was deadly efficient; Miller wasn't always the most unstoppable skill set to deal with and he
could be taken out of critical moments if he was forced to create off the dribble and shoot as many
contested shots as possible:
In game 7 against the Bulls in 98 it took Jordan pretty much going all out to make sure Miller never
look on any of his shots in that 4th quarter just to shut him down. So; it wasn't the easiest strategy
it took 2/3 GOAT-level players in
Kobe and MJ to make Miller ringless.
But, yeah; the ball-handling/ball-in-hand and creation part of the game is where someone with higher
volume is likely more dangerous than Miller: a player that is more skewed towards
a pure shooter.
All of that
said, it's very possible that Miller is just one of the best versions of a player that would've
gone down as an All-time #2 or 1B Option. It's easily possible he would've won more had he been paired
with a player/team that had a better #1/1A option.
A good example: put Miller on that mid-200Os Detroit team instead of Rip Hamilton. I'd say that's mostly
an
upgrade in
way: Miller is a better 3pt shooter than Rip and probably matches or exceeds him in
everything else. Miller probably even wins finals MVP instead of Billups.
think; to some
degree; Reggie was just overtasked on the offensive end and all the crazy feats he pulled"
