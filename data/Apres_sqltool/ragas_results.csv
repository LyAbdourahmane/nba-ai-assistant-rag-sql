Quelle est la principale critique concernant l'efficacité de Reggie Miller en tant que premier option offensive en playoffs ?,"La principale critique concernant l'efficacité de Reggie Miller en tant que premier option offensive en playoffs est qu'il n'a jamais été un scoreur dominant au niveau des points par match. Il a rarement dépassé les 20 points de moyenne par saison et n'a jamais atteint les 25-30 points par match, contrairement à d'autres joueurs de son époque. Son usage rate (USG%) est resté modéré, ce qui suggère qu'il n'était pas toujours la principale menace offensive de son équipe. De plus, certains estiment qu'il aurait eu besoin d'un meilleur soutien ou d'un créateur de jeu pour permettre à son équipe de franchir les étapes finales des playoffs.","[""maybe more playoff succes.\n14\nRépondre\nrealfakejames\n-10j\nComm. du top 1%\nWhen Reggie was playing there was one guard spot on the east every year guys had to compete for\nbecause the other automatically was Michael Jordan Imao\n4 4\nRépondre\n[supprimé]\n-10 j\nOverall-Palpitationg\n~10 j\nModifié il y a -10 j\nHe barely averaged 20 a game most years.
