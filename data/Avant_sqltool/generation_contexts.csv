There is one caveat
can think of for Miller that might slightly skew the data in his favor:
As dangerous as he was, Miller could be taken out of a game more easily than other first options because
his shot creation game relied so much on moving off ball or creation through the triple threat; but his
ball-handling wasn't always flexible enough to probe defenses like a lot of others on this list:.
Teams that had success could just try and smother him off-ball and force him into playing off the dribble
more once he caught it, which is the less reliable part of his offensive game:
So he could be neutralized more effectively by forcing him to choose between
'no shot"" or a
""bad/difficult shot""
Reggie's lower-ish volume would suggest he skews towards ""no shot"" sometimes.
This is compared with other players that have more dangerous ISO/OTD games like Jordan; LeBron; or
even
Their
game leads to better playmaking and
shots near the rim. And in the case
of Jordan and
(or even Kawhi and Durant)
are more dangerous as hybrid threats.

shots near the rim. And in the case
of Jordan and
(or even Kawhi and Durant)
are more dangerous as hybrid threats.
So; while he was deadly efficient; Miller wasn't always the most unstoppable skill set to deal with and he
could be taken out of critical moments if he was forced to create off the dribble and shoot as many
contested shots as possible:
In game 7 against the Bulls in 98 it took Jordan pretty much going all out to make sure Miller never
look on any of his shots in that 4th quarter just to shut him down. So; it wasn't the easiest strategy
it took 2/3 GOAT-level players in
Kobe and MJ to make Miller ringless.
But, yeah; the ball-handling/ball-in-hand and creation part of the game is where someone with higher
volume is likely more dangerous than Miller: a player that is more skewed towards
a pure shooter.
All of that
said, it's very possible that Miller is just one of the best versions of a player that would've
gone down as an All-time #2 or 1B Option. It's easily possible he would've won more had he been paired
with a player/team that had a better #1/1A option.
A good example: put Miller on that mid-200Os Detroit team instead of Rip Hamilton. I'd say that's mostly
an
upgrade in
way: Miller is a better 3pt shooter than Rip and probably matches or exceeds him in
everything else. Miller probably even wins finals MVP instead of Billups.

gravity can be from a first option. It's just less obvious in counting stats compared to ISO games.
Maybe he didn't need a #1 and maybe he just needed a better supporting cast.
We can definitely conclude he was an incredibly efficient playoff scorer as the post says.

mostly agree with that. And I'm not trying to underplay how good Miller was.
would personally
rank him as good or better than Scottie Pippen as far as the 9Os are concerned. Miller is probably
in the top 10 if we're considering that he was way more consistent than a lot of players for that
entire decade.
He probably could have gotten by as a number 1 in the sense that he's a team's highest scorer,
but he probably needed someone to handle the creation part of things and take some on-ball
scoring load off of him to beat any of the teams he faced (and lost to) in the finals or conference
finals."

Ok s0 from 1991 to 2002 when Reggie averaged 24PPG on 17 shots a game; who exactly do
you think was the number one
option?
He's not
better player than any of the 20
listed, ofc not bc there is more to the game than
efficient scoring. But he definitely was a first option; and his resume is absolutely top 50
material. He won a lot for someone who never had a superstar teammate.

West had Elgin Baylor for most of his career,
with a few years of Goodrich and Wilt. Reggie had
nobody of comparable quality. West was 16-12 in playoff series for his career with
ring, compared to
14-15 with zero rings for Reggie. Given the massive difference in supporting cast;
think it's still closer
than you think; although West wins out as a more dominant player.
Oscar won 2 playoff series before becoming Kareem's sidekick,
don't think his gaudy stats are
enough to
him over Reggie
helping the Pacers win 14 playoff series.
Wade won 22 playoff series
rings but 14 of those
were with the
arguable GOAT at his
apex. The Heat had some really
years with Wade; without LeBron. Wade also fell off very quickly
after 2011.

was first team all-NBA ten times and Reggie was third team three times
No comparison really.
They had great teammates but
also played when there were much fewer teams so all the top
teams were absurdly loaded.
As for Wade; he was just better at his peak. Carried his team to a championship and was just
generally a more dominant force at both ends of the court. Can't really talk about Wade's lean
years when Reggie didn't win a playoff series until his sixth season. And Wade's post-2011 fall off
included him
a top 3 player on two championship teams.
Reggie played on some very good teams too. When everything around him was good; he made a
lot of noise in the postseason but he just never reached the same heights and the longevity isn't
enough to overcome that in my opinion

keep in mind that he didn't take nearly as many FGA per game as stars did back then or now. Like; he'd
often g0 6/8. And that's it.
Would more volume have lowered his numbers? Maybe; but
doubt it.
Also; very few players increase their stats in the playoffs. Reggie always did.

Wolves are not surprising if you had watched them,
had picked them to beat the Lakers in six and
was specifically the team
wanted to dodge in the first round the most
The have the highest ceiling of all the teams outside of OKC because
can be both elite offensively
and defensively. Their only real flaw is decision making at times, but even then Ant has improved
hugely on that end.
think
were ultimately under estimated as too many crowned the Lakers as
better than
are actually are. Especially after the OKC HZHs where their shooting output just wasn't very
realistic of who
were in a Playoff
setting.
think the next best team is the Clippers; but man
have definitely found ways to lose games
against the Nuggets
But ultimately think it's going to end up pretty comfortably a OKC-MIN WCF and that is going to be
an insane series.

Cade has really impressed with his play but even more so with his leadership.
think Detroid has a

chill him out and stop him from getting a stupid tech was some real shit.

While
think NBA marketing has something to do with it; you also can't manufacture hype and interest
nothing.
This is where eras of parity are bad for casual viewers. It takes time and prolonged dominance to attract
the attention of casual viewers. Casual viewers that don't live and breathe the NBA probably still think
LeBron and Curry are the best players in the world. They don't realize that the Thunder are a historically
great team; or that the Pacers are in back to back conference finals. Having 7 different teams and sets of
players win the last
finals is exciting for die-hard fans, but bad for casual viewers as there is no
opportunity for continual discourse about a team that's dominating.
